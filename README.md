**SECURE PLATFORM ENGINEERING | EVERYTHING-AS-CODE** | **COLORADO, USA** 
> Delivering scalable secure solutions that transform business strategy into adaptive, automated architecture with just enough human-in-the-loop.

### About

A career in platform engineering and security architecture has centered on codifying infrastructure, hardening distributed systems, and developing pragmatic operational tools tailored to business constraints.

* **Expert Platform Orchestration:** Expert in operating self-hosted K8s and managed services (EKS, AKS, GKE). Author of modular Azure/AWS stacks using Terraform, Terragrunt, and GitOps (Flux CD) to accelerate developer velocity.
* **High-Integrity Security & Identity:** Architected foundational identity transitions (LDAP/Kerberos) to cloud-resident K8s. Expert in HashiCorp Vault, SOPS, and Shamir Sharding for enterprise encryption and Zero-Trust architecture.
* **Systems Engineering at Scale:** Developer of high-performance tools in **Go** and **Python**; notably reduced service drain times from 6 minutes to 25 seconds in high-concurrency environments. Executed CIS compliance and day-zero hardening for petabyte-scale data flows.

## 🛠️ Projects

> While the majority of my professional work is private, these repositories represent a selection of my public contributions and personal passion projects.

### ☸️ Kubernetes / Infrastructure-as-code

- 🔷 **[Kate's Kitchen](https://github.com/iancaseydouglas/kates-kitchen)** *Kubernetes Clusters A'la'Carte: a radically simple Terraform UI for orchestrating even the most complex cluster configurations.*

- 🔷 **[Varlink](https://github.com/iancaseydouglas/varlink)** *Go-based CLI for streamlining Terraform IaC via hierarchical inheritance; designed for both interactive local development and automated CI/CD pipelines.*

- 🔷 **[Cluster Security Audit](https://github.com/iancaseydouglas/cluster-security-audit)** *Automated framework for K8s posture assessment and production hardening of petabyte-scale genomics data flows; enforces CIS Benchmarks and PSP for Day Zero compliance.*

### 🛡️ Security / Identity

- 🔷 **[Modernizing Identity Perimeters](files/new_directions_in_AD.pdf)** *A Reference Architecture for zero-trust identity fabrics via peer-to-peer IPv6 IPsec mesh. Developed for Stanford IT’s Core Infrastructure cloud initiative to deliver encrypted Domain Services across thousands of VPCs with overlapping CIDR blocks.*

- 🔷 **[Cloud-Native Identity Orchestration](https://github.com/iancaseydouglas/k8s-ldap)** *Partnered with Stanford IAM and Cloud teams to transition hierarchical LDAP services to K8s on EC2; implemented the stateful replication logic, automated DB restoration, and CI/CD pipelines.*

### 🌲 Personal / Passion Projects

- 🔷 **[Flux Kontext CLI](https://github.com/iancaseydouglas/flux_kontext_cli)** *Go-based CLI for Black Forest Labs' Flux Kontext Pro, built with functional programming principles. Implements enterprise-grade security for generative AI asset pipelines.*

- 🔷 **[Dreamkraft](https://github.com/iancaseydouglas/dreamkraft)** *Exploring Generative AI within infrastructure lifecycles; automating asset pipelines and programmatic scaffolding to bridge the gap between creative strategy and Architecture-as-Code.*

- 🔷 **[Carousel Showcase](https://github.com/iancaseydouglas/carousel-showcase)** *A clean implementation of modular UI components and responsive design tailored for high-signal technical portfolios.*
